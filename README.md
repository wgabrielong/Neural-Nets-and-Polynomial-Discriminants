# Neural Networks and Discriminant Loci of Parameterized Polynomial Systems: First Examples

This GitHub repository contains code for the forthcoming paper "Neural Networks and Discriminant Loci of Parameterized Polynomial Systems: First Examples" by Wern Juin Gabriel Ong and Anna Seigal. 

Herein, we describe the functionality of each file: 

<ul>
  <li><b>ED_computation.jl</b> contains the computation of solutions to the critical points of the hypersurface in $\mathbb{R}^{6}$ defining the function class of depth 1 width 0 neural networks. It returns a Julia dataframe with real critical points and their corresponding distances in $\mathbb{R}^{6}$ to the discriminant polynomial. This code appears in the proof of Proposition 4.3. </li>
  
  <li><b>fiber_over_discriminant.jl</b> contains the code to compute the $w,b$-parameters that cause a neural network of width 2 depth 2 to correspond exactly to the discriminant polynomial. This code appears in the proof of Proposition 4.2. </li>
  
  <li><b>Quad W0D1.ipynb, Quad W1D2.ipynb, Quad W1D3.ipynb, Semi Quad W1D2.ipynb, Semi Quad W1D3.ipynb, Semi Quad W1D4.ipynb, Semi Quad W2D2.ipynb</b> These files compute the function classes of a quadratic or semi quadratic neural network of width k and depth d. This code appears in the proof of Theorem 3.1 and Theorem 4.1.</li>
  
  <li><b>data_generator.py:</b> This file is responsible for creating the dataset used for training and testing the neural networks. It generates parameters and their corresponding real root structures.</li>
  
  <li><b>decision_boundary_visualization.py:</b> This script provides functions for visualizing the decision boundaries formed by the neural networks. It helps in validating the accuracy of the machine learning approach to approximating the discriminant locus.</li>
  
  <li><b>main.py:</b> This file ties together the functionalities of all other files. It provides an interface for running experiments, training neural networks, computing and visualizing discriminants.</li>
  
  <li><b>utils.py:</b> This file contains utility functions used across the other scripts. These might include common mathematical operations, data manipulation routines, and performance evaluation functions.</li>
  
  <li><b>requirements.txt:</b> This file lists the Python libraries that need to be installed to run the code.</li>
</ul>
